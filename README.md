# CS 141 Project

### About
In the summer term of 2024-2025, I took CS 141, a computer science project course that focuses on projects for the public sector. I chose to focus on promoting adult literacy. This is a chrome extension that gives word definition and pronunciation help, while offering connections to the Los Angeles Public Library’s literacy resources. I've included my project write-up for more information.
